Random Pick with Weight (Leetcode #528)
===============================
### Medium

You are given an array of positive integers `w` where `w[i]` describes the weight of `i`th index (`0`-indexed).

We need to call the function `pickIndex()` which randomly returns an integer in the range `[0, w.length - 1]`. `pickIndex()` should return the integer proportional 
to its weight in the w array. For example, for `w = [1, 3]`, the probability of picking the index `0` is `1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25` (i.e `25%`) while the probability
of picking the index `1` is `3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75` (i.e `75%`).

More formally, the probability of picking index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]
Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. Since there is only one single element on the array the only option is to return the first element.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It's returning the second element (index = 1) that has probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It's returning the first element (index = 0) that has probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed so the following outputs can be considered correct :
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]
......
and so on.
 
```

### Constraints:
```
1 <= w.length <= 10000
1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
```

Solution
========

```python
# O(N) for creation
# O(logN) for picking
class Solution:

    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        self.prefix_sum = []
        curr = 0
        for ww in w:
            curr += ww
            self.prefix_sum.append(curr)
       
    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        total = self.prefix_sum[-1]
        r = random.random() * total
        # Binary search to find index
        return bisect.bisect_right(self.prefix_sum, r)

# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(w)
# param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
```
