Encode String with Shortest Length (Leetcode #471)
===============================
### Hard

Given a non-empty string, encode the string such that its encoded length is the shortest.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times.

#### Note:

1. `k` will be a positive integer.

2. If an encoding process does not make the string shorter, then do not encode it. If there are several solutions, return any of them.
 

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: "aaa"
Explanation: There is no way to encode it such that it is shorter than the input string, so we do not encode it.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aaaaa"
Output: "5[a]"
Explanation: "5[a]" is shorter than "aaaaa" by 1 character.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "aaaaaaaaaa"
Output: "10[a]"
Explanation: "a9[a]" or "9[a]a" are also valid solutions, both of them have the same length = 5, which is the same as "10[a]".
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: s = "aabcaabcd"
Output: "2[aabc]d"
Explanation: "aabc" occurs twice, so one answer can be "2[aabc]d".
```

### Example 5:
```
Input: s = "abbbabbbcabbbabbbc"
Output: "2[2[abbb]c]"
Explanation: "abbbabbbc" occurs twice, but "abbbabbbc" can also be encoded to "2[abbb]c", so one answer can be "2[2[abbb]c]".
``` 

### Constraints:
```
1 <= s.length <= 150
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
```

Solution
========
* `case 1: s is not repeated -> use s (e.g. b -> b)`
* `case 2: s is repeated -> collapse to x[y] (e.g. aaaaa -> 5[a])`
* `case 3: slide a split point and split s into 2 piece and compute case 1, 2 (e.g. aaaaaabbbbb -> 6[a]5[b])`
* `take the minimum of case 1, 2, 3`

### GPT solution
Use a DP table dp[i][j] to represent the shortest encoded string for the substring s[i:j+1].

Steps:

Base Case:

* If the substring length is 1, dp[i][j] = s[i:j+1].

Check for Repetition:
* For a substring s[i:j+1], check if it can be formed by repeating a smaller substring. For example:
"aaaa" â†’ "4[a]".

* Check all possible segment lengths k, such that k divides the substring length L.

Partition the Substring:
* Divide the substring into two parts at every possible position k and combine the results:
  
* dp[i][j] = dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j].

Choose the Shortest:
* For each substring s[i:j+1], store the shortest encoding.

def encode(s: str) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[""] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    for length in range(1, n + 1):  # Length of the substring
        for i in range(n - length + 1):  # Start index
            j = i + length - 1  # End index
            substring = s[i:j+1]
            
            # Initialize with the substring itself
            dp[i][j] = substring
            
            # Try splitting the substring into two parts
            for k in range(i, j):
                if len(dp[i][k]) + len(dp[k+1][j]) < len(dp[i][j]):
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j]
            
            # Try encoding the entire substring
            for k in range(1, length // 2 + 1):  # k is the segment length
                if length % k == 0 and substring[:k] * (length // k) == substring:
                    encoded = f"{length // k}[{dp[i][i + k - 1]}]"
                    if len(encoded) < len(dp[i][j]):
                        dp[i][j] = encoded

    return dp[0][n-1]
